# 12. Timer

## 12.1 Timer 0/1

Timer0 / 1 are two 16-bit timer / counters. TCON and TMOD are used to configure Timer0 and Timer1. TCON is used for timer / counter T0 and T1 start control and overflow interrupt and external interrupt control. Each timer is a 16-bit timing unit consisting of two 8-bit registers. The high byte counter of timer 0 is TH0, the low byte is TL0; the high byte counter of timer 1 is TH1, and the low byte is TL1. Timer 1 can also be used as a baud rate generator for UART0.

## 12.2 Timer2

Timer2 is a 16-bit auto-reload timer/counter. It is configured through the T2CON and T2MOD registers. The high byte counter of timer 2 is TH2 and the low byte is TL2. Timer2 can be used as the baud rate generator of UART0. It also has two signal level capture functions. The capture count is stored in RCAP2 and T2CAP1 registers.

In capture mode, bT3_CAP_M1 and bT3_CAP_M0 select the capture edge: when bT3_CAP_M1 and bT3_CAP_M0 are 00, the capture mode is turned off or suspended; when it is 01, the edge is activated by any edge, that is, the change in level, and the capture is from any edge to any edge; when it is 10 Activated by falling edge, capture from falling edge to falling edge. When it is 11, activate by rising edge, capture from rising edge to rising edge.

In PWM mode, bT3_CAP_M1 and bT3_CAP_M0 select the number of data repetitions: When bT3_CAP_M1 and bT3_CAP_M0 are 00, the data is not reused, that is, a new data is used every PWM cycle. When it is 01, the data is reused 4 times, that is, the same data is used for continuous 4 PWM cycles. When it is 10, the data is reused 8 times. When it is 11, the data is reused 16 times.

## 12.4 PWM Function

Timer3 of CH559 has a 16-bit PWM function. In addition, there are two other 8-bit PWMs. The PWM can choose the default output polarity to be low or high. It can dynamically modify the PWM output duty cycle. After the simple RC resistor and capacitor perform integral low-pass filtering, various output voltages can be obtained, which is equivalent to a low-speed digital-to-analog converter DAC.

PWM3 output duty cycle = T3_FIFO / T3_END, the support range is 0% to 100%. If the value of T3_FIFO is greater than T3_END, it is treated as 100%.

PWM1 output duty cycle = PWM_DATA / PWM_CYCLE, support range 0% to 100%, if the value of PWM_DATA is greater than PWM_CYCLE, it will be treated as 100%.

PWM2 output duty cycle = PWM_DATA2 / PWM_CYCLE, the support range is 0% to 100%. If the value of PWM_DATA2 is greater than PWM_CYCLE, it is treated as 100%.

In practical applications, it is recommended to allow the PWM pin output and set the PWM output pin to push-pull output mode.

</div>

Data format captured by Timer3:

Timer3 can be used to capture the width between two valid edges of the signal.The width is expressed by the divided clock count. During or after the capture, the width data can be obtained through DMA or directly reading the FIFO.The data is 16 bits. The most significant bit is the identification bit and the lower 15 bits are the width count. After signal capture is enabled, data will be generated every time a valid edge is detected or every timer overflows.Because the data generated at the first valid edge is the width from the time when signal capture is enabled, not two valid edges Width, so the first data captured is usually discarded.

(1). bT3_CAP_M1 and bT3_CAP_M0 = 11

The rising edge is valid, capturing the signal width from the rising edge to the rising edge, that is, the rising edge is activated. If the highest bit of the data is 1, it means that the signal width has overflowed the counting end value, that is, if the timing exceeds T3_END and the next rising edge has not been found, the width value must be added to the width of the next data whose highest bit is 0. The most significant bit is 0, which means that the width is the width between the end of a certain rising edge, and whether the lower 15 bits are accumulated forward according to whether the most significant bit of some previous data is 1. In this mode, it is recommended to set T3_END to detect ultra-wide signals or end signals for special purposes, and normal signals should not overflow.

For example, T3_END is set to 4000h, and the raw data sequence collected is as follows

1234h, 2345h, 0456h, C000h, C000h, 1035h, 3579h, C000h, 2468h, and 0987h are combined to obtain the interval between each rising edge: 1234h, 2345h, 0456h, 9035h, 3579h, 6468h, 0987h

(2). bT3_CAP_M1 and bT3_CAP_M0 = 10

Same as above, but the falling edge is valid, capturing the signal width from the rising edge to the falling edge, that is, the falling edge is activated.


(3). bT3_CAP_M1 and bT3_CAP_M0 = 01

Any edge is valid, capturing the signal width from any edge to any edge, that is, the level change is activated. If the highest bit of the data is 1, then the width is a high-level width, that is, from the rising edge to the falling edge. If the highest bit of the data is 0, then the width is a low-level width, that is, from the falling edge to the rising edge. The lower 15 bits after masking the most significant bits are width values counted by the divided clock. In this mode, it is recommended to set T3_END to a larger value to avoid timing overflow, but it must not exceed 15 digits of valid data.
