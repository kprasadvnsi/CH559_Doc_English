# 8-bit enhanced USB microcontroller CH559

## 1. Overview

The CH559 chip is an enhanced E8051 core microcontroller compatible with the MCS51 instruction set. Its 79% of instructions are single-byte single-cycle instructions, and the average instruction speed is 8 to 15 times faster than the standard MCS51.

The CH559 supports up to 56MHz system clock speed, built-in 64K program memory Flash-ROM and 256-byte internal iRAM and 6K bytes of on-chip xRAM. Some xRAMs support DMA direct memory access.

The CH559 has built-in ADC analog-to-digital conversion, four groups of timers and PWM, dual asynchronous serial port, dual SPI, and other functional modules, as well as a built-in dual-port Root-HUB that supports USB-Host host mode and USB-Device device mode.

The following is an internal block diagram of the CH559 for reference only.
